                content: `The desk lamp cast a warm glow across Honami's bedroom, bathing everything in soft amber light. Mafuyu sat at the desk, calculus textbook open before her, one arm wrapped securely around Honami's waist while the other held her pencil with practiced precision.

Honami was a comfortable weight in her lap, legs tucked to the side, body curved against Mafuyu's in a way that had become familiar over the past few weeks. She scrolled idly through her phone, occasionally showing Mafuyu pictures of constellations or cute dogs, humming softly under her breath—some melody Mafuyu didn't recognize but had grown to associate with contentment.

"Mm," Honami murmured, shifting slightly to get more comfortable. Her head rested against Mafuyu's shoulder, breath warm against her collarbone.

Mafuyu's pencil moved across the page, solving equations with mechanical efficiency even as most of her awareness remained focused on the girl in her arms. The weight. The warmth. The gentle rise and fall of Honami's breathing.

This had become their routine when studying at Honami's house—Honami would settle into Mafuyu's lap like it was the most natural thing in the world, and Mafuyu would hold her while working through problem sets. It was inefficient, illogical, and Mafuyu never wanted it to stop.

Honami shifted again, this time nuzzling her face against Mafuyu's neck, and Mafuyu felt the soft press of her nose, the gentle brush of her lips against sensitive skin.

Her breath caught. The pencil stilled.

Honami made a small, pleased sound, completely unaware of what she'd just done. She rubbed her cheek against Mafuyu's neck like a cat seeking affection, and Mafuyu felt something hot and urgent unfurl in her chest.

"Honami," she said, and her voice came out rougher than intended.

"Hmm?" Honami looked up, blue eyes soft and curious and so close. Her lips were slightly parted, pink and soft and right there.

Mafuyu's control, already threadbare, snapped.

She dropped the pencil—heard it clatter somewhere distant and unimportant—and brought her hand up to cup the back of Honami's head. For a moment, she just held there, giving Honami time to pull away, to say no, to realize this was a bad idea.

But Honami just looked at her with those wide, trusting eyes, and whispered, "Mafuyu?"

And then Mafuyu was kissing her.

It wasn't gentle. Wasn't the careful, tentative thing it probably should have been. Mafuyu pressed forward with sudden intensity, capturing Honami's lips with her own, and Honami made a startled sound that dissolved into something softer, more yielding.

Mafuyu's arm tightened around Honami's waist, pulling her closer, and then she was standing, lifting Honami with her, turning, pressing her back against the desk. Books and papers scattered—Mafuyu didn't care. All that mattered was the feeling of Honami's body against hers, the small gasp Honami made as her back met the desk surface, the way her hands came up to grip Mafuyu's shoulders.

"Mafuyu—" Honami breathed against her lips, but Mafuyu swallowed the rest of the words, kissing her deeper, harder.

She brought one hand up to Honami's throat, not squeezing exactly, just resting there with gentle pressure. Honami's pulse fluttered rapidly beneath her fingers like a trapped bird. She pressed down slightly—just enough to make breathing a little harder, just enough to make Honami's cheeks flush darker.

Honami's eyes went wide, pupils dilating, and she made a sound that went straight through Mafuyu like electricity.

"Is this—" Mafuyu started, pulling back just enough to check, to make sure.

"Yes," Honami gasped out, her voice breathless and slightly strangled. "Yes, please don't stop—"

Mafuyu's other hand came up to cover Honami's eyes, palm pressed gently over them, blocking her vision. She felt Honami shiver beneath her, felt the way her breathing got faster, more desperate.

"Keep them closed," Mafuyu murmured against Honami's lips.

"Okay," Honami whispered, and she sounded wrecked already, completely undone.

Mafuyu kissed her again, slower this time but no less intense. She traced Honami's bottom lip with her tongue, felt Honami's sharp intake of breath, and then Honami was opening for her, letting her in, and the taste of her was overwhelming.

Sweet. Warm. Everything.

Honami whimpered—a high, needy sound that made Mafuyu press harder against her, made her deepen the kiss until Honami was trembling, hands clutching desperately at Mafuyu's shirt.

The hand on Honami's throat felt her swallow, felt every small sound she tried to make, felt the way her pulse raced faster and faster. Mafuyu adjusted her grip slightly, pressing just a bit more, and Honami's whole body arched, a broken moan escaping.

"Mafuyu—I can't—"

"Breathe," Mafuyu said softly, easing the pressure just enough. "I've got you."

And she did. She had Honami pinned beneath her, spread across the desk, eyes covered, throat held gently but firmly, completely at her mercy. And Honami trusted her. Let her do this. Wanted her to do this.

The realization was intoxicating.

Mafuyu kissed her way along Honami's jaw, down to her throat, feeling the rapid flutter of her pulse against her lips. Honami's hands tangled in her hair, pulling slightly, and the small sting of pain only drove Mafuyu further.

"You feel so good," Honami breathed, voice shaking. "I didn't know—I didn't know it could feel like this—"

Mafuyu returned to her mouth, kissing her thoroughly, tongue exploring, tasting, claiming. Honami met her eagerly, messily, all technique abandoned in favor of pure need.

Time became meaningless. There was only this—the heat between them, the taste of Honami's mouth, the feeling of her body pressed against Mafuyu's, soft and yielding and so perfectly trusting.

When Mafuyu finally pulled back, they were both breathing hard. Her hand still covered Honami's eyes, her other hand still rested against Honami's throat. Honami lay beneath her, lips swollen and red, cheeks flushed, completely beautiful.

"Can I look?" Honami asked softly.

Slowly, Mafuyu lifted her hand.

Honami's eyes opened, slightly unfocused, and she looked up at Mafuyu with something like wonder.

"That was..." she started, then seemed to lose the words.

"Too much?" Mafuyu asked, suddenly worried she'd gone too far, taken too much.

"No." Honami reached up, cupping Mafuyu's face with both hands. "Perfect. That was perfect."

She pulled Mafuyu down for another kiss, gentler this time, sweeter, and Mafuyu let herself be drawn in, let herself feel this warmth without fear, without questioning whether she deserved it.

When they finally separated, Mafuyu carefully helped Honami sit up. Her calculus textbook lay on the floor, pages crumpled. Neither of them mentioned it.

"Your homework—" Honami started, looking guilty.

"Can wait," Mafuyu said, and meant it.

Honami smiled, that soft, warm smile that made Mafuyu's chest ache, and pulled her close again. "Come here."

And Mafuyu did, settling beside her on the desk, Honami curled against her side, both of them quiet and content in the amber lamplight.

Some things, Mafuyu was learning, were more important than perfect grades.`

                content: `Mafuyu had been living with Kanade for three months now.
Three months since she'd finally left her mother's house. Three months since Kanade had opened her door and said, without hesitation, "Stay as long as you need." Three months of sharing space in Kanade's house, learning each other's rhythms, becoming something more than friends but without a name for it yet.

Mafuyu thought she knew everything about Kanade by now.

She was wrong.

It was a Tuesday night. Mafuyu was at the desk they shared—technically Kanade's desk, but Mafuyu had claimed half of it for her homework. She was working through calculus problems, the scratch of her pencil the only sound in the house besides the distant hum of Kanade's computer.

Kanade was supposed to be composing. But Mafuyu heard her get up from her chair, heard the soft pad of bare feet on the floor.

Then arms wrapped around her from behind.

Mafuyu stiffened instinctively—old habits from her mother's house, where touch meant inspection, correction, control. But these arms were gentle. Familiar.

"Kanade?" She relaxed slightly, though her pencil was still poised over the paper. "Do you need something?"

Kanade didn't answer. Her chin settled on Mafuyu's shoulder, her cheek pressing against Mafuyu's. Her breath was cool against Mafuyu's neck.

Actually—Mafuyu noticed with a strange jolt—Kanade's breath was always cool. Room temperature at best, never warm like a normal person's.

"You smell nice," Kanade mumbled, and her voice had a distant quality to it. Distracted. Almost dreamy.

Mafuyu frowned. "Are you feeling alright? You sound—"

Kanade's nose brushed against her neck. Breathing her in deeply.

"Kanade, what are you—"

The bite was sudden.

Sharp pressure, two points of pain piercing the skin of her neck. Mafuyu gasped, her pencil clattering to the desk. Her body went rigid, then strangely, inexplicably relaxed. The pain faded into something else—a pulling sensation, gentle but insistent. Warmth spread from the bite, flowing through her veins like honey.

Her vision blurred at the edges. The room tilted slightly. She felt heavy and light at the same time, her mind floating while her body stayed pinned to the chair by Kanade's arms.

It didn't hurt. That was the strangest part. It should hurt, but it didn't.

The pulling stopped.

Kanade jerked back like she'd been burned. Mafuyu heard her stumble, hitting the bed. She turned slowly—her body still felt syrupy, slow to respond—and found Kanade sitting on the floor, back pressed against the bed frame.

Kanade's eyes were wide. Terrified. Her lips were stained red.

Red with blood.

Red with Mafuyu's blood.

"I'm sorry," Kanade gasped. The words tumbled out fast, tripping over each other. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to—I was just so hungry and you smelled so good and I lost control—I'm so sorry—"

Mafuyu touched her neck. Her fingers came away wet and red. She stared at them for a moment, processing. Two neat puncture wounds, already starting to close. Not bleeding heavily, just... there.

Her mind was still slow, still processing through the honey-warm haze. But the facts assembled themselves clearly:

Kanade had bitten her neck.

Kanade had drunk her blood.

Kanade's lips were still red with it.

"You're a vampire," Mafuyu said. Her voice was calm. Distant. Like she was commenting on the weather.

Kanade flinched like she'd been slapped. "I—yes. I should have told you. Before you moved in. Before we—I should have told you." Her hands were shaking. "I'm terrible at this. I'm terrible at hunting, terrible at controlling myself, I just—you were right there and you smelled so good and I haven't fed in almost a week because I didn't want you to find out—"

"How long?" Mafuyu interrupted.

Kanade blinked. "What?"

"How long have you been a vampire?"

"I—" Kanade's voice cracked. "Since I was born. It's hereditary. Both my parents were vampires. It's why they were always so sickly, why they couldn't leave the house much. The sun hurts us. Not enough to kill, but enough to make everything painful. And the food—normal food makes us nauseous unless it's really bland. That's why I only eat cup noodles. No garlic, no spices, just... plain."

Mafuyu listened. Her mind was clearing now, the warmth fading. She looked at Kanade—really looked.

The unnaturally pale skin. Not just from staying inside, but porcelain-white, bloodless. The way she kept her apartment freezing cold, even in summer. The blackout curtains that never opened. The way she only ever ordered the plainest cup noodles, nothing with flavor packets that might contain garlic.

All the little things that Mafuyu had noticed and dismissed.

They all made sense now.

"We need to tell Mizuki and Ena," Mafuyu said.

Kanade's face went even whiter, if that was possible. "No. Please, Mafuyu, they'll—they'll hate me. They'll think I'm a monster. They'll leave Nightcord, and it'll be my fault—"

"They won't hate you."

"You don't know that!" Kanade's voice broke. Tears spilled down her cheeks, pink-tinged. "You don't know what they'll think when they find out I'm—that I drink—"

Mafuyu stood. Her legs were still a little unsteady, but she made it to Kanade and knelt in front of her. She took Kanade's ice-cold hands in hers.

"I know them," she said firmly. "And I know you. They'll understand. But we can't keep this secret. Not if you're going to feed. Not if you're going to survive." She squeezed Kanade's hands. "Let's go to the SEKAI. Together. Right now."

Kanade looked terrified. Her whole body was trembling. But after a long moment, she nodded.

They connected to the SEKAI together, Mafuyu still holding Kanade's hand.

The Empty SEKAI materialized around them—vast white void, stretching endlessly in all directions. Mafuyu sent a message through Nightcord to Mizuki and Ena.

Emergency meeting. Come now.

They appeared within minutes.

Mizuki materialized first, headphones around her neck, concern written across her face. "What's wrong? Did something happen?"

Ena appeared next, paint still smudged on her hands. "This better be important. I was in the middle of—" She stopped. Her eyes zeroed in on Mafuyu's neck. "What happened to you?"

Mafuyu touched the bite marks. They were still visible, two small punctures. "Kanade bit me."

Silence.

Mizuki's eyes went wide. "She what?"

"I bit her," Kanade said quietly, staring at the ground. She still hadn't let go of Mafuyu's hand. "I'm a vampire. I've always been a vampire. I didn't tell you because I was scared you'd hate me, that you'd leave Nightcord, that you'd think I was a monster. I didn't mean to bite Mafuyu. I just—I lost control. I haven't fed in a week and she was right there and she smelled good and I'm not good at hunting, I'm terrible at this, I'm terrible at being a vampire—"

"Wait," Ena interrupted. "Slow down. You're a vampire. Like, an actual vampire."

"Yes."

"And you drink blood."

"Yes."

"Human blood."

Kanade's voice was barely a whisper. "Yes."

More silence.

Then Mizuki laughed.

It was bright and delighted, echoing in the empty space. "Kanade, that's amazing!"

Kanade's head snapped up. "What?"

"You're a vampire! That's so cool!" Mizuki was grinning, her earlier concern completely evaporated. "That explains everything! Why you're always so pale, why you only eat those boring noodles, why your house is like a freezer—"

"Hey," Kanade pouted. "It's not that cold."

"It's 60 degrees Fahrenheit in there. That's freezing."

Ena was still processing, her arms crossed. "So you need to drink blood to survive."

"Yes," Kanade said nervously.

"Human blood specifically."

"Yes. Animal blood doesn't work. I don't know why, it just—it doesn't sustain us."

"And you bit Mafuyu because you were hungry."

Kanade flinched. "I didn't mean to. I should have controlled myself better. I should have gone out and hunted properly, but I'm terrible at it. I can never catch anyone. I'm too slow, too obvious. The only reason I managed to bite Mafuyu is that she trusts me and wasn't expecting it." Her voice cracked again. "I'm a terrible vampire."

Ena studied her for a long moment. Then she sighed. "Okay. So how often do you need to feed?"

Kanade blinked. "You're... not mad?"

"Why would I be mad?" Ena's expression softened slightly. "You're still Kanade. You're still our composer, still our friend. You just happen to need blood to survive." She paused. "Although biting Mafuyu without warning was pretty messed up."

"I know," Kanade said miserably. "I'm sorry. I should have asked. I should have—"

"Don't apologize to us," Ena said. "Apologize to her."

Kanade turned to Mafuyu. "I'm so sorry. Really. I should have told you before you moved in. I should have asked before I fed. I should have—"

"It's okay," Mafuyu interrupted. She meant it. "You were hungry. You lost control. It happens."

"It shouldn't happen. I should be better at controlling my instincts."

"Then we'll help you," Mizuki said firmly. "That's what Nightcord is for, right? We help each other." She clapped her hands together. "So! Feeding schedule. How often do you need blood, and how much?"

Kanade looked overwhelmed. "Every three to four days. I can go longer if I have to, but I get weak, and the hunger gets harder to control. As for how much..." She glanced at Mafuyu's neck. "What I took from Mafuyu just now would last me about three days."

"So not that much," Mafuyu noted. She felt fine, actually. A little tired, maybe, but nothing serious.

"Okay," Mizuki said. "So we set up a rotation. The three of us take turns. That way you're not going too long without feeding, and none of us are giving too much too often."

"You'd do that?" Kanade's voice was small, disbelieving. "You'd let me feed from you?"

"Of course," Mizuki said immediately. "We're friends. We take care of each other."

Ena nodded. "What they said. But I have conditions."

Kanade tensed. "What conditions?"

"First: you ask permission every single time. No surprise biting, ever. Even if you're starving, you ask first."

"I promise," Kanade said quickly.

"Second: you tell us immediately if you're feeling too hungry. Don't wait until you lose control. We'd rather feed you early than have you suffer."

"Okay."

"Third:" Ena's expression was serious. "You stop calling yourself a terrible vampire. You're not terrible. You're just... new at asking for help."

Kanade's eyes filled with tears. "Okay."

They worked out the details. Mafuyu would go first in the rotation, since she'd already been bitten. Then Mizuki in three days. Then Ena three days after that. Then back to Mafuyu. The cycle would repeat, with adjustments if Kanade needed to feed sooner.

Kanade would text the person whose turn it was at least an hour beforehand, asking permission and confirming they were feeling well enough to donate.

"There's one more thing," Kanade said hesitantly. "About being a vampire. Sometimes when I get startled—really startled, genuinely scared—I... transform."

"Transform into what?" Mafuyu asked.

"A bat."

Mizuki's eyes lit up. "Can we see?!"

"I can't do it on command," Kanade said quickly. "It's not voluntary. It just happens when I'm frightened or—"

Mizuki clapped her hands together. The sound was sharp and sudden in the empty space, echoing like a gunshot.

Kanade yelped—

And then she wasn't there anymore.

In her place, a small white bat hovered in the air, wings flapping frantically. It was tiny, maybe the size of Mafuyu's hand, with soft white fur and wide blue eyes that looked comically large on its small face.

"Oh my god," Mizuki breathed. "You're adorable."

The bat squeaked indignantly and flew in an unsteady circle.

Mafuyu held out her hands. "Kanade. Come here."

The bat hesitated, then flew over and landed in Mafuyu's cupped palms. It was warm—warmer than Kanade usually was in human form. Its little body trembled against Mafuyu's skin.

"It's okay," Mafuyu said softly. "You're safe. We're not going to hurt you."

The bat—Kanade—nuzzled into her palm. Made a small chirping sound.

"How does she change back?" Ena asked, leaning closer to examine the bat.

The bat squeaked. Then, with a small poof of displaced air, Kanade was back in human form. Still in Mafuyu's hands.

Kanade jumped apart, face flushing red.

"So," Mizuki said, grinning widely. "Tiny bat Kanade. This is the best thing I've learned all week."

"It's not that great," Kanade mumbled, still pink. "I can't control when it happens. Loud noises don't trigger it, but genuine fear does. Jump scares. Sudden threats. That kind of thing."

"It's cute," Mafuyu said.

"It's embarrassing."

"It's cute," Mafuyu repeated firmly.

Kanade hid her face in her hands.

They talked for a while longer, hammering out more details. Kanade explained about the sun—how it gave her splitting migraines but wouldn't kill her, how she needed sunglasses and long sleeves if she went out during the day. She explained about garlic—how even the smell made her violently ill, how ingesting it could actually kill her.

"So no Italian food," Ena noted.

"No Italian food," Kanade agreed sadly.

When they finally left the SEKAI, Mafuyu and Kanade found themselves back in their shared house. Kanade immediately slumped onto her bed, emotionally exhausted.

"That went better than I expected," she admitted.

"I told you they wouldn't hate you," Mafuyu said.

"I know. I just..." Kanade looked at her hands. "I've been hiding this my whole life. My parents told me to never tell anyone, that people would be scared, that they'd hurt me. It's strange to have people know and... not care."

"They care," Mafuyu corrected. "They just don't care that you're a vampire. They care about you."

Kanade smiled. Small and genuine. "Yeah. They do."

Mafuyu sat beside her on the bed. "Are you still hungry?"

"A little. But I can wait until the rotation—"

"Kanade." Mafuyu tilted her head, exposing her neck. "Feed."

"Are you sure? You already gave me blood earlier—"

"I'm sure. You said you haven't fed in a week. You need more than one feeding to make up for that."

Kanade hesitated. Then she moved closer, gentle and careful. She pushed Mafuyu's hair aside—dark purple strands sliding through her fingers—and pressed her lips to Mafuyu's neck.

Right over where she'd bitten before.

"Thank you," she whispered against Mafuyu's skin.

Then she bit down.

The sensation was familiar now. The sharp sting, then the warmth flooding through her. Mafuyu closed her eyes and felt Kanade drinking. She could feel each pull, each swallow. It was intimate in a way she hadn't expected. Trusting. Vulnerable.

Kanade pulled away after a minute. She licked the wounds—Mafuyu shivered at the sensation—and the punctures sealed, healing almost instantly.

"All done," Kanade said softly. Her lips were red again, but her eyes were clearer. Brighter. Less exhausted.

"Feel better?" Mafuyu asked.

"Much. Thank you."

They sat together in the quiet house, the blackout curtains keeping the world at bay. Outside, it was probably still light. But in here, in their shared darkness, they were safe.

---

Days turned into weeks. The rotation continued smoothly. Mafuyu, Mizuki, Ena, repeat. Kanade never missed a feeding, and none of them ever felt weak or drained.

They learned Kanade's quirks:

The sun gave her splitting headaches. She could go out during the day if she absolutely had to, but she needed sunglasses and long sleeves and a hat, and even then she'd come home and have to lie in a dark room for hours.

Garlic was deadly. Not an exaggeration. Even the smell made her ill. They'd learned that the hard way when Mizuki had brought garlic bread to a Nightcord meeting. Kanade had transformed into a bat immediately and refused to change back for two hours, until the smell had completely dissipated.

She was always, always cold. The house was kept at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Mafuyu had gotten used to sleeping under three blankets.

She only ate cup noodles. Plain ones, with no flavor packets. Anything with spices or garlic or even too much salt made her nauseous. Rice was okay. Plain bread was okay. Everything else made her sick.

She'd learned how to control her transformation into a bat, so it wasn't only when she was startled but now on command.

And she was getting more comfortable. More open. More willing to ask for help.

She came to most of Mafuyu's school days now, tucked safely in her bag or lap. She went with Mizuki to her rare school appearances, providing comfort on the roof when the whispers got too loud. She spent every Tuesday and Thursday with Ena at night class, sitting in her lap and occasionally trying (and failing) to help with art supplies.

She fed on schedule. Always asked permission. Always thanked them afterward.

One night, after everyone had gone home, Mafuyu and Kanade were lying in bed together. The room was dark, curtains drawn, the world shut out.

"Thank you," Kanade said quietly.

"For what?"

"For not hating me. For helping me. For letting me be part of your life even though I'm—"

"Kanade." Mafuyu turned to face her. "You're not a burden. You never were."

"I drink your blood."

"And I let you because I care about you. Because you're important to me. Because—" Mafuyu paused. "Because this is what family does. We take care of each other."

Kanade's eyes went bright. "Family?"

"Yes. You, me, Mizuki, Ena. We're family. Not by blood—well, except for the blood you drink—but by choice."

Kanade laughed. It was wet and choked, but genuine. "That was a terrible pun."

"You're smiling."

"I am." Kanade reached out and took Mafuyu's hand. "Thank you. For choosing me."

"Always," Mafuyu said.`

                content: `The sun rose over a world that didn't deserve it.

Mafuyu watched the light crawl across the broken skyline from their perch on the fifth floor of what used to be an apartment building. The windows were long gone, shattered into glittering fragments that crunched underfoot. The city stretched out before them—skeletal and gray, buildings like broken teeth jutting up from cracked pavement.

It had been beautiful once. She remembered that, in the distant way you remember dreams. Neon signs and crowded streets and the smell of takoyaki from corner stalls. Music pouring out of storefronts. Laughter.

Now there was only silence.

Kanade stirred beside her, wrapped in a threadbare blanket they'd found three days ago. Her silver hair was dull with dust, face too pale, dark circles carved deep under her eyes. She'd been getting thinner. They both had.

"Morning," Kanade mumbled, voice rough from sleep.

"Morning." Mafuyu didn't look away from the window. "We should move soon."

"Where to?"

"South. There might be supplies near the old shopping district."

"We checked there already."

"Not the basement levels."

Kanade sat up slowly, joints popping. She was eighteen but moved like she was sixty. They both did. "Okay."

They packed in silence. There wasn't much to pack—two backpacks, half-full. A few cans of food, their labels long faded. Water bottles, carefully rationed. A first aid kit with mostly empty packaging. A knife each. A flashlight with dying batteries.

Everything they owned in the world.

Mafuyu strapped her backpack on and felt the familiar weight settle against her spine. She'd stopped noticing the ache weeks ago. Kanade did the same, moving with the practiced efficiency of someone who'd done this too many times.

"Ready?" Mafuyu asked.

Kanade nodded.

They left the apartment building through the fire escape. The streets were empty—they always were, this early. The things that wandered the city at night retreated with the sun. Not dead, not alive. Just hungry.

They'd learned to move with the light.

The walk to the shopping district took two hours. Neither of them spoke. There was nothing left to say that they hadn't already said a hundred times before. The silence between them was comfortable now, familiar as breathing.

Mafuyu's mind drifted as they walked.

She thought about Mizuki. About the last time she'd seen her—running ahead, laughing about finding an untouched convenience store, turning a corner, and just... gone. They'd searched for three days. Found nothing but Mizuki's backpack, torn and bloodied.

She thought about Ena. About how they'd planned to meet up at the station. About waiting there for a week, watching the days tick by, hope dying a little more each sunrise.

She thought about how she and Kanade were all that was left of Nightcord.

Two people in a dead world.

Kanade's hand found hers.

Mafuyu looked over. Kanade wasn't looking at her, eyes fixed ahead, but her fingers were warm and solid and real. Mafuyu squeezed back.

They kept walking.

The shopping district was a graveyard.

Storefronts gaped open like wounds. Mannequins lay scattered across the floor, plastic limbs bent at wrong angles. Shopping carts overturned, their contents long since looted or rotted away.

"Stay close," Mafuyu said.

"Always do."

They moved through the wreckage carefully. Every sound was too loud—their footsteps, their breathing, the rustle of their clothes. Mafuyu's hand hovered near her knife.

The basement entrance was at the back, past the food court. The escalators were frozen, stairs leading down into darkness. Mafuyu pulled out the flashlight and clicked it on. The beam was weak, yellow, barely pushing back the shadows.

"I'll go first," she said.

"No." Kanade's voice was firm. "Together."

Mafuyu wanted to argue. But Kanade was already stepping onto the first stair, and Mafuyu could only follow.

The basement was untouched.

Dust lay thick over everything. Shelves still stood in neat rows, though most were empty. But there—in the back corner—boxes. Unopened. The labels were faded but readable.

Canned goods. Water. Medical supplies.

"Kanade," Mafuyu breathed.

They moved faster now, pulling boxes open with shaking hands. Cans of soup. Beans. Fruit. Bottles of water, still sealed. Bandages. Antiseptic. Pain medication.

It was a fortune.

"We can't carry all of this," Kanade said, already stuffing her backpack.

"We'll take what we can. Come back for more."

They worked quickly, methodically. Filling their backpacks until they couldn't fit anything else. Mafuyu's hands were trembling. When was the last time they'd had this much food? When was the last time they hadn't gone to bed hungry?

"Mafuyu." Kanade's voice was odd.

Mafuyu looked up.

Kanade was holding something. A small package, wrapped in plastic. Mafuyu squinted at it in the flashlight beam.

Chocolate.

"It's probably stale," Kanade said.

"Probably."

"We should save it."

"We should."

Kanade unwrapped it anyway. Broke it in half. Held one piece out to Mafuyu.

Mafuyu took it. Put it in her mouth. It melted on her tongue—creamy and smooth and impossibly sweet. She closed her eyes.

When she opened them, Kanade was crying.

Silent tears, tracking through the dust on her cheeks. She was still chewing, still smiling, but crying.

Mafuyu reached out and wiped her tears away with her thumb.

"It's okay," she said softly.

"I know." Kanade's voice cracked. "I know. I just—"

"I know."

They stood there in the dark basement, surrounded by their impossible treasure, and held each other. Kanade's forehead pressed against Mafuyu's shoulder. Mafuyu's hand in her hair.

"We're going to be okay," Kanade whispered.

Mafuyu didn't answer.

---

They made camp in an office building.

Twentieth floor. High enough to see danger coming, low enough to escape if needed. They'd set up in a corner office with two walls of windows, now covered with blankets to hide the light from their small fire.

The fire was a risk. But it was cold tonight, and they needed to cook the soup.

Mafuyu watched the flames while Kanade heated the can over them, stirring with a bent spoon. The light played across her face, orange and warm. She looked less exhausted today. The food was helping.

Four days since the shopping district. Four days of eating regularly. Four days of almost-normalcy.

"It's ready," Kanade said.

They shared the can between them, passing it back and forth. It was chicken noodle soup, and it tasted like everything good Mafuyu had ever forgotten. She savored each mouthful.

"Do you think about them?" Kanade asked suddenly.

Mafuyu didn't have to ask who. "Every day."

"Me too." Kanade stared into the can. "I dream about Ena sometimes. She's worried for me because I'm not eating enough. Typical Ena."

Mafuyu felt something twist in her chest. "Mizuki used to leave me voice messages. Just random thoughts throughout the day. I listened to them so many times I memorized them."

"Do you still have your phone?"

"No. Battery died months ago."

Kanade nodded slowly. "I wish I could make music again. Even just once. I'd write something for them."

"What would you write?"

"I don't know. Something about..." Kanade trailed off. "Something about how even at the end of the world, they weren't alone. That we were together."

Mafuyu's throat felt tight. She reached out and took Kanade's hand.

"We're still together," she said.

"Yeah." Kanade squeezed back. "We are."

They finished the soup. Put out the fire. Settled into their sleeping bags, positioned close together for warmth. The windows rattled with wind. Somewhere in the distance, something howled.

Mafuyu listened to Kanade's breathing slow and even out. She wanted to sleep, but her mind wouldn't quiet.

She thought about before. About her mother's expectations and the perfect daughter she'd tried to be. About the mask she'd worn until it felt more real than her face. About how none of that mattered anymore.

She thought about how she'd learned to feel again in this broken world. How fear and grief and love had crept back in, unwanted but undeniable.

She thought about Kanade. About how she couldn't imagine doing this alone.

"Mafuyu?" Kanade's voice was sleepy.

"Yes?"

"Thank you. For staying."

"Where else would I go?"

"I don't know. But... thank you anyway."

Mafuyu turned on her side, facing Kanade through the darkness. "Thank you for staying too."

Kanade's hand found hers between their sleeping bags.

They fell asleep like that, fingers intertwined.

---

They'd been searching a hospital for medical supplies—specifically antibiotics. Kanade had a cough that wouldn't go away, and Mafuyu was taking no chances. The hospital was dangerous, they both knew that. Hospitals always were. But desperation made you stupid.

They moved through the halls slowly. Emergency lighting still worked in patches, casting everything in a sickly green glow. Gurneys lay abandoned in hallways. Papers scattered across the floor. The smell was wrong—chemical and sweet and rotten.

"This was a bad idea," Kanade whispered.

"We're almost to the pharmacy."

"Mafuyu—"

A sound. Distant but distinct. Scraping. Shuffling.

They froze.

Mafuyu's hand went to her knife. Kanade's breathing was too loud, too fast. The cough that had brought them here rattled in her chest.

"Quiet," Mafuyu breathed.

Kanade nodded, pressing her hand over her mouth.

The sound came again. Closer.

Mafuyu grabbed Kanade's wrist and pulled her into the nearest room. A patient room, bed unmade, IV stand toppled over. She eased the door mostly closed, leaving just a crack to see through.

They waited.

The thing that shuffled past was barely human anymore. Gray skin pulled tight over bone. Eyes milky white. Mouth hanging open, black tongue lolling. It moved with jerky, unnatural movements, head twitching at odd angles.

It paused outside their door.

Mafuyu felt Kanade tense beside her. She tightened her grip on her knife. If it came in, she'd have to be fast. Aim for the head. Don't hesitate.

The thing sniffed the air.

Then, slowly, it shuffled on.

They waited five more minutes before moving. Mafuyu counted each second in her head. When she reached three hundred, she carefully pushed the door open.

The hallway was empty.

"Let's go," she whispered.

The pharmacy was locked, but the lock was old and rusted. Mafuyu forced it with her knife, and they slipped inside.

Shelves mostly bare. Already looted. But there—in the back, behind the counter—a cabinet. Locked but intact.

Mafuyu forced that lock too.

Inside, bottles and bottles of medication. She scanned the labels quickly. Antibiotics. Pain medication. Anti-inflammatories. She started stuffing them into her backpack.

"Mafuyu, we should hurry," Kanade said.

"Almost done."

"No, I mean—" Kanade coughed. The sound echoed.

The shuffling sound returned. Closer now. Multiple sources.

"Go," Mafuyu said. "Back door."

They ran.

Down the hallway, Kanade's backpack bouncing against her spine, Mafuyu's knife still in her hand. Behind them, the shuffling turned into something faster. They could hear it—the wet slap of feet on linoleum, the wheezing breaths.

The back door was ahead. Mafuyu slammed into it, and it burst open into the alley.

They ran.

Two blocks. Three. Four. Didn't stop until they couldn't hear the sounds anymore. They collapsed in an alley, chests heaving.

"Are you okay?" Mafuyu gasped.

Kanade nodded, too breathless to speak.

Mafuyu checked her over anyway. No bites. No scratches. Just dirt and sweat and fear.

"We're not doing that again," Kanade said.

"Agreed."

They sat there until their breathing slowed. Until the adrenaline faded and left them shaky and exhausted. Mafuyu pulled out one of the antibiotic bottles.

"Here," she said. "Take one now."

Kanade obeyed without argument. Swallowed it dry.

"Better?" Mafuyu asked.

"Ask me in a few days."

They walked back to their office building in silence. The sun was starting to set, painting the broken city in shades of orange and red. It would've been beautiful if it wasn't so lonely.

---

Kanade's cough was getting better.

Mafuyu told herself that's what mattered. That the antibiotics were working. That Kanade was going to be fine.

But she still woke up in the middle of the night to check that Kanade was still breathing.

---

They'd settled into a routine. Wake at dawn. Scavenge for a few hours. Return before dark. Eat. Sleep. Repeat.

It was almost peaceful.

Today they were checking the residential area. Apartments were usually picked clean, but sometimes you got lucky. Sometimes people had hidden supplies in clever places.

They moved from building to building, floor to floor, apartment to apartment. Most were empty. Some had signs of struggle—furniture overturned, dark stains on the walls. They didn't linger in those.

"Hey," Kanade called from another room. "Come look at this."

Mafuyu walked over. Kanade was standing in what used to be a bedroom. Children's bedroom, from the looks of it. Posters on the walls. Toys scattered on the floor.

Kanade was holding a stuffed animal. A white rabbit, worn and loved.

"Reminds me of the one you had," she said softly. "When you were little."

Mafuyu watched her trace the rabbit's ear with one finger.

"Do you ever wish we could go back?" Kanade asked.

"To before?"

"Yeah. To when things were normal."

Mafuyu considered the question. Did she want to go back to the perfect daughter? To the empty smile and the hollow achievements?

"No," she said finally.

Kanade looked surprised.

"I felt…cold before," Mafuyu explained. "I didn't know who I was. What I wanted. I was just... going through the motions."

"And now?"

"Now I know what matters." Mafuyu met Kanade's eyes. "Now I know what I want to protect."

Kanade's expression softened. She put the rabbit down carefully, reverently. "Me too."

They finished searching the apartment. Found a few cans of food, a box of crackers. Not much, but enough.

As they left, Kanade paused at the door. Looked back at the rabbit, sitting on the small bed.

"Do you think..." she started, then stopped.

"What?"

"Do you think anyone survived? Somewhere else?"

Mafuyu didn't know. They hadn't seen another living person in weeks. The radio had been silent for months.

"Maybe," she said.

"Maybe," Kanade echoed.

They walked home in the fading light.

---

The building was unstable.

Mafuyu noticed it first—the way the floor creaked under their weight. The cracks spider-webbing across the walls. The dust that drifted down from the ceiling.

"We should find somewhere else," she said.

"Where?" Kanade asked. "We've been through everything in this area."

"We could go further out. Into the suburbs."

"That's a week's walk. Maybe more."

"We have supplies now."

Kanade looked around their makeshift camp. The office had become home over the past two weeks. Their sleeping bags. Their carefully organized supplies. The corner where they kept their trash, planning to dispose of it safely.

"One more night," Kanade said. "We'll leave tomorrow. I just want one more night somewhere that feels... safe."

Mafuyu wanted to argue. But Kanade looked tired, and the sun was already setting, and maybe one more night would be okay.

"Okay," she said. "One more night."

They made a small fire. Cooked their food. Ate in comfortable silence. The wind picked up outside, rattling the covered windows. The building groaned.

"Tell me something," Kanade said.

"About what?"

"Anything. I just want to hear your voice."

Mafuyu thought for a moment. "I've been thinking about the future."

"What future?"

"Our future. When this is over."

Kanade smiled sadly. "When is it going to be over, Mafuyu?"

"I don't know. But someday. And when it is..." Mafuyu stared into the fire. "I want to live somewhere quiet. With an aquarium. With fish."

"You've never had fish before."

"I know. But I want to learn. I want to have something beautiful." She glanced at Kanade. "What about you?"

"I want to make music again," Kanade said immediately. "Real music. Not just humming to myself. I want to write something that matters."

"All your music mattered."

"I want to write something that gives people hope. That tells them they're not alone."

Mafuyu reached over and took her hand. "You already do that."

Kanade's eyes went bright. She squeezed Mafuyu's hand hard.

"When this is over," Kanade said, voice shaking slightly, "I want to live with you and your aquarium. And write music for you. And be happy."

"We'll be happy," Mafuyu promised.

They sat there, hands linked, making plans for a future that felt impossible but necessary.

Because without hope, what was the point?

The building groaned again. Louder this time.

"Just one more night," Kanade whispered.

"Just one more night," Mafuyu agreed.

---

It happened so fast.

They were packing up, preparing to leave. Mafuyu was rolling up the sleeping bags while Kanade organized their food supplies. The morning light was pale and gray through the covered windows.

And then the floor shook.

Not violently. Just a tremor. A shift.

They both froze.

"We need to go," Mafuyu said. "Now."

They grabbed their backpacks, abandoned everything else. Ran for the door. The building was groaning constantly now, a low sound that Mafuyu felt in her bones.

They made it to the stairs. Started down. Twentieth floor to ground level.

Nineteenth floor. Eighteenth. Seventeenth.

The building lurched.

Kanade stumbled. Mafuyu grabbed her arm, kept her upright. They kept running.

Sixteenth. Fifteenth. Fourteenth.

The stairwell was cracking. Chunks of concrete falling. Dust thick in the air.

"Don't stop," Mafuyu gasped.

They didn't.

Thirteenth. Twelfth. Eleventh.

Something gave way above them. A sound like thunder. Mafuyu looked up and saw the ceiling collapsing.

"Run!"

They ran.

Tenth floor. Ninth. Eighth.

They weren't going to make it.

Mafuyu knew it with sudden, terrible clarity. The building was coming down, and they were still too high up, and they weren't going to make it.

Seventh floor.

The stairs in front of them collapsed.

They skidded to a stop, teetering on the edge. Below, six floors of empty air. Above, the ceiling crumbling.

"This way!" Kanade pulled her through a door, into the seventh floor hallway.

They ran down the hall, building shaking itself apart around them. Doors falling off hinges. Windows shattering. The floor tilting at an angle.

Kanade was ahead. She reached a window at the end of the hall. Looked out.

"There's a fire escape!"

She climbed through. Mafuyu followed.

The fire escape was rusted but intact. They scrambled down it, feet clanging on metal. The building groaned behind them, a death rattle.

Sixth floor. Fifth. Fourth.

"Jump!" Kanade yelled.

They were at the third floor. Too high to jump safely, but the building was collapsing and they had no choice.

They jumped.

Mafuyu hit the ground hard, rolling with the impact. Pain shot through her shoulder, her hip. She gasped for air.

"Kanade!"

"I'm okay!" Kanade was on her feet, limping but moving. "Come on!"

They ran.

The building came down behind them. A roar like the end of the world. Dust and debris exploding outward. Mafuyu felt the shockwave hit her back, sending her stumbling. Kanade grabbed her hand, pulled her forward.

They didn't stop running until they were three blocks away.

They collapsed in the street, coughing, covered in dust. Mafuyu's whole body ached. Her hands were shaking. She looked over at Kanade.

Kanade was laughing.

Breathless, pain-edged, hysterical laughter.

"We're alive," she gasped between laughs. "We're actually alive."

Mafuyu started laughing too. It bubbled up from her chest, uncontrollable and wild. They sat there in the ruined street, covered in dust and blood and bruises, laughing like they'd lost their minds.

Maybe they had.

When the laughter finally died, Kanade leaned against Mafuyu's shoulder.

"That was close," she said.

"Too close."

"Hey, Mafuyu?"

"Yes?"

"I'm glad I'm with you."

Mafuyu wrapped an arm around her. "Me too."

They sat there until they caught their breath. Then they stood, checked each other for serious injuries, and started walking.

Away from the rubble. Toward the suburbs. Toward whatever came next.

Together.

---

The suburbs were quieter.

Houses with overgrown yards. Cars abandoned in driveways. Swing sets rusting in the rain.

It felt more haunted than the city. More personal. These had been homes. Lives.

They moved through them carefully, reverently. Taking what they needed but leaving things as undisturbed as possible. It felt important, somehow. Like honoring the dead.

They found a house on the third day. Two stories, white with blue shutters. The door was unlocked. Inside, everything was dusty but intact.

"What do you think?" Kanade asked.

Mafuyu walked through the rooms. Living room with a couch. Kitchen with a table. Bedrooms upstairs. A bathroom with a tub.

"We could stay here," she said. "For a while."

They cleaned the house as best they could. Swept out the dust. Wiped down surfaces. Made the master bedroom livable. It felt strange, domestic. Like playing house at the end of the world.

That night, they slept in an actual bed.

Mafuyu lay there in the dark, feeling the mattress beneath her instead of the hard floor. Kanade was beside her, warm and solid.

"This is nice," Kanade murmured.

"It is."

"Maybe we could stay here. Really stay. Get an aquarium."

Mafuyu thought about it. A house. Something permanent.

"Maybe," she said.

But she thought: nothing is permanent anymore.

---

Kanade's cough came back.

"It's nothing," she insisted. "Just the dust."

Mafuyu gave her more antibiotics anyway.

They rationed carefully, making the medication last. Kanade took one pill every twelve hours. The cough improved, then worsened, then improved again.

Mafuyu told herself it was working.

---

Kanade collapsed.

They were checking a house two streets over. Kanade had been moving slowly all morning, breathing hard. Mafuyu had asked if she was okay. Kanade had said yes.

And then she wasn't.

One moment she was standing. The next she was on the ground, eyes rolled back.

"Kanade!" Mafuyu dropped to her knees. "Kanade!"

Kanade's eyes fluttered open. "I'm... okay..."

"You're not okay. What hurts?"

"Nothing. Just dizzy."

Mafuyu felt her forehead. Hot. Too hot.

"You have a fever."

"It's fine."

"It's not fine." Mafuyu pulled Kanade's arm over her shoulder and hauled her to her feet. "We're going back. Now."

The walk back took twice as long as it should have. Kanade could barely walk. She leaned heavily on Mafuyu, feet dragging. By the time they reached the house, she was only semi-conscious.

Mafuyu got her into bed. Stripped off her outer layers. Felt her forehead again.

The fever was high.

She grabbed the first aid kit. They had medicine—fever reducers, the antibiotics. She gave Kanade both, forcing her to swallow with water.

"Stay with me," she said. "Kanade. Stay with me."

"M'here," Kanade mumbled.

Mafuyu sat beside the bed and waited.

The fever didn't break.

Kanade was getting worse.

The fever climbed higher. She drifted in and out of consciousness, mumbling things Mafuyu couldn't understand. Mafuyu kept giving her medicine, kept trying to get her to drink water.

Nothing helped.

She didn't know what was wrong. Infection? Disease? Something she'd contracted weeks ago that was only now showing symptoms?

It didn't matter. All that mattered was making her better.

Mafuyu barely slept. She kept watch by Kanade's bedside, monitoring every breath. Sometimes Kanade would open her eyes and seem lucid for a moment.

"Mafuyu?"

"I'm here."

"Don't leave."

"Never."

Kanade would smile weakly and drift off again.

Mafuyu held her hand and tried not to think about the last time she'd watched someone slip away.

---

On the third day, Kanade woke up clear-eyed.

"Hey," she said, voice rough.

Mafuyu nearly sobbed with relief. "You're awake. How do you feel?"

"Like I got hit by a truck." Kanade tried to sit up and winced. "What happened?"

"Fever. You've been unconscious for two days."

"Two days?" Kanade looked shocked. Then guilty. "I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize. You're okay now. That's what matters."

Kanade reached for her hand. Squeezed weakly. "Thank you. For taking care of me."

"Always."

They sat in silence for a moment. Kanade's eyes were already drooping again.

"Rest," Mafuyu said. "I'll make you something to eat when you wake up."

"Mafuyu?"

"Yes?"

"I love you."

Mafuyu's breath caught. Kanade had never said it out loud before. Neither of them had.

"I love you too," she said softly.

Kanade smiled and closed her eyes.

Mafuyu watched her sleep and let herself hope.

---

Kanade seemed better. The fever was gone. She could sit up, eat a little, talk normally. Mafuyu let herself believe the worst was over.

They decided to check the stream again. Refill their water. Get some fresh air.

Kanade insisted she was strong enough. Mafuyu believed her.

They made it to the woods. To the stream. Filled their bottles in comfortable silence.

"I've been thinking," Kanade said.

"About what?"

"About those footprints. We should try to find them. Whoever they are."

"Kanade—"

"I know it's risky. But Mafuyu... what if they need help? What if they're alone like we were?"

Mafuyu wanted to say no. Wanted to keep Kanade safe, isolated, just the two of them forever.

But Kanade was looking at her with those eyes. Hopeful and determined.

"Okay," Mafuyu said. "We'll look. Tomorrow. When you're stronger."

Kanade beamed.

They started back toward the house.

That's when they heard it.

A sound. Low and wet. Shuffling.

They froze.

Through the trees, something moved. Gray skin. Jerky movements. Three of them.

"Run," Mafuyu whispered.

They ran.

But Kanade was still weak. Still recovering. She couldn't move fast enough.

The things behind them were faster.

Mafuyu grabbed Kanade's hand, pulling her forward. Her mind raced. They needed to get to higher ground. Needed to find shelter. Needed to—

Kanade stumbled.

She went down hard, crying out. Mafuyu turned back, reaching for her.

The things were close. So close.

Mafuyu pulled out her knife. "Get up! Kanade, get up!"

Kanade was trying. She was on her feet, limping, and they were running again but it wasn't enough.

One of the things lunged.

Mafuyu intercepted it. Drove her knife into its skull. It went down.

Two left.

"Mafuyu!" Kanade screamed.

Mafuyu spun. The second one was grabbing at Kanade. Kanade was fighting it off, knife in hand, but she was too slow, too weak.

Mafuyu ran.

She didn't make it in time.

The thing's teeth sank into Kanade's shoulder.

Kanade screamed.

Mafuyu killed it. Drove her knife through its eye and into its brain. It dropped.

The third one was coming.

"Go!" Kanade gasped. "Mafuyu, go!"

"No."

Mafuyu met the third one head-on. It was stronger than the others, faster. They grappled. It snapped at her face. She twisted, brought her knife around, stabbed it in the throat.

It went down.

Silence.

Mafuyu turned.

Kanade was on the ground, hand pressed to her shoulder. Blood seeped through her fingers. Her face was white.

"Let me see," Mafuyu said, voice shaking.

Kanade moved her hand.

The bite was deep. Ragged. The skin already turning gray at the edges.

No.

No no no no no.

"Mafuyu." Kanade's voice was calm. Too calm. "It's okay."

"It's not okay. We have antibiotics. We have—"

"Mafuyu."

"We can treat it. We can—"

"Mafuyu, look at me."

Mafuyu looked. Kanade's eyes were clear. Accepting.

"It's over," Kanade said softly.

"No."

"Yes. You know what happens now."

Mafuyu did know. She'd seen it before. The bite. The infection. The slow transformation. There was no cure. No treatment.

Only time.

"How long do I have?" Kanade asked.

"Hours. Maybe less."

"Then we should go home."

Mafuyu wanted to argue. Wanted to scream. Wanted to tear the world apart.

But Kanade was looking at her with those eyes. Patient. Loving.

"Okay," Mafuyu whispered. "Let's go home."

She helped Kanade to her feet. Wrapped her arm around her waist. They walked back through the woods slowly.

Kanade was already shaking.

---

They made it to the house.

Mafuyu helped Kanade to the bed. Kanade sat down heavily, breathing hard. The gray was spreading from the bite, veins darkening under her skin.

"I don't want to turn," Kanade said. "I don't want you to see me like that."

Mafuyu's hands were shaking. "I know."

"Will you..." Kanade swallowed hard. "Before it happens. Will you make it quick?"

Every word was a knife to Mafuyu's heart. "Yes."

"Thank you."

They sat in silence. Mafuyu held Kanade's hand and watched the gray spread.

"I'm sorry," Kanade said after a while.

"For what?"

"For being careless. For getting bit. For leaving you alone."

"You have nothing to apologize for."

"I do. You told me not to go into the woods. You were right." Kanade's laugh was bitter. "You were always right."

"I didn't want to be right."

Kanade squeezed her hand. "I know."

The shaking was getting worse. Kanade's pupils were dilating, the color fading from her eyes.

"Mafuyu?"

"I'm here."

"Tell me about the fish again. The ones you wanted to take care of."

Mafuyu's voice cracked. "Guppies. And a beta fish in a separate tank. And maybe some mollies."

"Sounds beautiful."

"It would have been."

"You'll still get them. When this is over. You'll take care of them, and the aquarium will be beautiful."

"Kanade—"

"Promise me. Promise me you'll keep living. That you'll find those footprints. That you'll find other people."

"I can't."

"Please." Kanade's grip was weakening. "Don't be alone. I can't... I can't leave you alone."

Mafuyu was crying now. She couldn't stop. "I promise."

"Thank you."

Kanade's breathing was changing. Becoming ragged. The gray had spread to her face, her neck. Her eyes were almost white.

"I love you," Kanade whispered. "I love you so much."

"I love you too." Mafuyu pulled her close, cradling her against her chest. "I love you. I love you."

Kanade's body jerked. A sound escaped her throat—wet and inhuman.

"Kanade?"

No response. Just that sound again. Kanade's fingers twitched. Her head lolled.

Mafuyu knew.

It was time.

"I'm sorry," she whispered into Kanade's hair. "I'm so sorry."

She laid Kanade back gently. Kanade's eyes were open but unseeing. Her mouth worked soundlessly.

Mafuyu picked up her knife.

Her hands wouldn't stop shaking.

"I love you," she said one more time.

She made it quick.

---

After, Mafuyu sat on the floor.

Kanade's body was on the bed. Still. Finally still.

Mafuyu should move it. Should bury it. Should do something.

She couldn't.

She pulled Kanade's body down into her arms and held on.

Kanade was cold now. The gray had stopped spreading. She looked almost peaceful, if you ignored the wound on her shoulder. If you ignored the gray veins.

If you ignored that she was dead.

"I'm sorry," Mafuyu whispered. "I'm sorry I couldn't save you. I'm sorry I wasn't fast enough. I'm sorry."

The words poured out of her. Apologies and confessions and prayers to gods she didn't believe in.

Kanade didn't answer.

The sun set. Rose again. Set again.

Mafuyu didn't move.

She'd lost everyone. Mizuki. Ena. And now Kanade. The last person she had. The last person she loved.

She was alone.

She should let go. Should bury Kanade properly. Should keep her promise.

But she couldn't. Not yet.

So she sat there in the empty house, holding Kanade's body, and let the world end around her.

Again.

And again.

And again.`
